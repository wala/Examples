织女 is an example of taint analysis across mutiple languages in [WALA](https://github.com/wala/WALA).

织女 (織女, zhī nǚ, Zhinü, [pronounciation](https://www.mdbg.net/chinese/dictionary?wdrst=0&popup=1&wdqchssp=%E7%BB%87%E5%A5%B3 )) is a [weaver goddess in Chinese legend](https://medium.com/saseprints/chinese-folktale-the-cowherd-and-the-weaver-girl-cd045f934a6).  织女 is a fitting name for our analysis:
1. 织女 uses the cross-language nature of WALA to weave together a single taint analysis for four different languages based on the Common AST (CAst) and components from the WALA core.
2. In legend, 织女 the goddess was one of those who used the 鹊桥 (Magpie Bridge), and 织女 the taint analysis uses [MagpieBridge](https://github.com/MagpieBridge/MagpieBridge).
